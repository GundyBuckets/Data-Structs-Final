# Data Structures

Welcome to my tutorial on how to use different data structures in programming. I believe that any C# programmer should understand and be able to use the following topics:

- [Queues](./2-queue.md)
- [Sets](./3-set.md)
- [Binary Trees](./4-binary-tree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and tutorials to help you learn how to use these Data Structures. And at the end of each of these tutorials, you will be given an example problem to solve on your own. Try to look at the solution only after you have attempted to solve the problem
